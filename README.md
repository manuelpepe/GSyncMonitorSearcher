# GSyncMonitorSearcher
Little project that helps me find out of new availbale G-Sync compatible monitors.
It scrapes the Nvidia page for compatible monitors, compares the monitors with the last run and sends an email with the new ones.

## TODO:
* Search for the monitors in popular selling sites (MercadoLibre) and notify price (if available).
